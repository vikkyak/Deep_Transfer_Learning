# 🧠 Deep Transfer Learning for Molecular Cancer Classification

This repository provides a MATLAB implementation of a **deep transfer learning framework** for **molecular cancer classification** using gene expression data. The approach leverages **deep neural networks (DNNs)** and **transfer learning** to improve classification accuracy across various cancer types, particularly when training data is limited.
